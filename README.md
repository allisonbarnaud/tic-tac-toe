## Introduction

    Tic Tac Toe is a simple game for 2 players. It is played on a 3 x 3 grid. 
    The first player to get 3 O's or X's lined up vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins the game.

## Objectives 

**Design & Functionality**

    - Start with a MVP which has the basic logic sorted
    - Keep the design simple and minimalistic, no fancy animations etc.

**Requirements** 

    - Document core (minimum) requirements 
    - Good to have features for future releases 

**Code** 

    - Plan code keeping the below in mind:

    1.  Scale easily when adding new features 
    2.  Easily readable / use comments wherever possible 
    3.  Divide code into functions, avoid hard coding
    4.  Use self-explanatory variable names

## Lessons 
    
    - Commit early, commit often. If things go sideways, you can always retrieve your last version 
    - Use percentages instead of pixels when designing the structure so it doesn't haunt you later when nothing aligns when you resize windows 
    - Scope creep is a real thing. Follow your plan to get the MVP running with all the basic functionality zipped up before thinking about enhancements  
    - Maybe I am getting old, but sometimes you don't remember your own code the next day. Commenting code is essential for debugging things later
